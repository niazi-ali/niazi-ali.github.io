abstract: This paper quantifies how wind and solar expansion shapes wholesale prices, market power, and the profitability of thermal generators. Using data from Albertaâ€™s energy-only market, I build an hourly competitive benchmark from unit-level marginal costs and decompose observed price movements into cost and markup components. I find that wind lowers prices in every hour, with roughly 40 percent of the decline coming from reduced markups. Solar reduces midday prices and markups but raises prices in the morning and evening; about one-third of those increases reflect higher markups as capacity tightens during solar ramp-up and ramp-down periods. Counterfactual capacity additions indicate a shift in value from energy to flexibility; inframarginal rents for low-cost combined-cycle units fall, while scarcity rents concentrate into fewer hours that favor fast-ramping units and storage. Adding zero-marginal-cost supply is therefore not, by itself, a cure for market power. Robust market design, transmission expansion, and flexible resources are essential to keep decarbonizing grids competitive and reliable.
