abstract: This paper quantifies how wind and solar expansion shape wholesale prices, market power, and generator profitability. Using data from Alberta's energy-only market, I construct an hourly cost-based competitive benchmark and decompose observed price movements into cost and markup components. Theoretically, zero-marginal-cost renewables owned by fringe, price-taking firms lower competitive prices, while under imperfect competition, the response of markup above the competitive price is ambiguous. Empirically, I show that wind lowers prices in every hour, with roughly 40% of the decline from markup compression. Solar reduces midday prices and markups but raises prices in the morning and evening as capacity tightens, with roughly one-third of those ramp-hour increases reflecting higher markups. Accounting for intraday spillovers, wind remains pro-competitive across the day, whereas solar's predictable ramps shift the scope for market power into morning and evening hours. Counterfactual capacity additions indicate a shift in value from energy to flexibility. Inframarginal rents for renewables and baseload combined-cycle units fall, while scarcity rents concentrate into fewer hours that favor fast-ramping units and storage. Wind increases consumer welfare via lower markups, while solar's ramp-hour markup increases partially offset midday gains. Importantly, adding zero-marginal-cost supply is not, by itself, a cure for market power. Robust market design and flexible resources are essential to keep decarbonizing grids competitive and reliable.
